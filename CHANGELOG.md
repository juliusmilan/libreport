## [Unreleased]


## [2.9.3] - 2017-11-02
### Added
- Added workflow for adding data to existing case.
- Enabled reporting of unpackaged executables.
- Allowed python to be optional at build time.

### Changed
- Python [23] binary packages were renamed to python[23]-libreport.
- Requires pythonX-dnf instead of dnf.

### Fixed
- Fix client-python's attempts to unlink None.
- Fix error in finding executable basename in rep-sys-journal.


## [2.9.2] - 2017-08-25
### Added
- Add count field into default logs, not just FULL dump. It is useful to know
if some problem occurred first time or is it problem that happens a lot.
- Add journal entry PROBLEM_DIR. This features is requested by ABRT cockpit
plugin.
- Add newly added cpuinfo files into editable files list. This files are newly
saved by ABRT because some bugs are related to HW acceleration.

### Fixed
- Fix libreport augeas for trailing whitespaces and around value separator (=)
in libreport configs.
- Update glib minimal version dependency, this bug caused update problems when
updating libreport and pre-2.28 glib was installed.
- Fix missing newline when asking for password.
- Fix a bug causing inconsistent order of username and password fields when
reporting bugs.


## [2.9.1] - 2017-03-16
### Added
- New element 'container_rootfs' has been introduced. The element should
contain file system path of container's root directory.

### Changed
- Deciding if a process has own root is no longer based on comparing inodes of
process' root and system root but mountinfo results are compared instead. This
approach does correctly recognize chroot in a container.

### Fixed
- Fix several critical bugs affecting results in parsing of
the /proc/[pid]/mountinfo file.


## [2.9.0]
### Added
- Introduce new plugin for reporting problems to systemd-journal.
- Add workflow definitions for reporting JavaScript stack traces.
- Enhance the reportclient python module with support for $releasever in the
debug info downloader to be able to download debug info packages for the
version of operating system captured in problem details.
- Introduced a new global configuration option 'stop_on_not_reportable'
controlled by the 'ABRT_STOP_ON_NOT_REPORTABLE' environment variable to enable
clients to force libreport to always report problems regardless of possible
sensitive data leaks and report usability concerns.

### Changed
- Add "systemd-logind" and "hawkey" to the list of not highlighted sensitive
words.
- Enhance the Bugzilla reporter to include only essential packaging details to
make Bugzilla bug reports easier to comprehend.
- Generate nicer truncated backtraces by filtering out less valuable functions.
- Ask users to do security review of several more files.
- Use lz4 instead of lz4cat because the latter has stopped working.
- Reword several log messages to provide users with more valuable output.
- Move the lookup for Bodhi updates from the C/C++ analysis to a separate step
in Fedora workflows.

### Fixed
- Start controlling logging verbosity through ABRT_VERBOSE in the reportclient
python module.
- Test processes for own root by checking /proc/1/root instead of / to be able
to run libreport code in a container or a changed root environment.
- Fix formatting of the configuration format in 'man reporter-mailix'.
- Refuse to parse negative number as unsigned int when parsing configuration
files.
- Correctly detect errors by resetting errno to no error before calling
functions reporting errors through errno.
